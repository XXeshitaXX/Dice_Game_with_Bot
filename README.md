# Dice_Game_with_Bot
I created a game in which users can play a competitive dice game with a bot.
The programming language used for this project is Python.
In this game,user would get chance to roll as many dices they want.The sum of the numbers displayed on the dices would be calculated.
Similarly,the bot would automatically roll same number of dices and sum would be calculated in the same way.
At last,the sum would be compared and the one with the greater sum would be declared the winner.
